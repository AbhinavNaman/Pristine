urf JunkHunt- a city cleaning app

Idea 1: It's related to cleaning the cities which are highly polluted. 1st is using this website to create awareness which is basic.

Cleaning the city is a very important thing which everyone knows, still, some cities are so dirty. So we need something more to create motivation for ordinary people. Garbage management and all are not enough, people need to participate in it

So 2nd, which is the main objective is can create a platform that gives badges (like Google platforms) or points to those who:

Maps or locate the dirty areas. And updating about it

Who forms a small group, cleans the mapped location, and earns points and badges.

The 1st one can keep track of it and then map it out of the list.

People can upload pictures of before and after. Can share their initiative of cleaning the city (that will create a self-proud thing for people)

And with those points or badges, we can set some milestones, completing those people can get awarded by the government may be in a form of a certificate or medal

To make it more tech-advanced: => We can use blockchain for authentication and maybe DB. => instead of a certificate, we can give a unique NFT => ML for creating charts and prediction of a future trend like the rate of decrease in pollution and estimate dates...

It's a social cause project, good for hackathons and techy too
