Keeping your Environment clean doesn't always mean not throwing garbage around but it also means to actually clean the mess which we created.

Cleaning your city is also not always the responsibility of the government and the NGOs but also the citizens that is we are equally responsible for cleaning our city. 

Hence,
We have created a web app called Pristine which means clean and pure, its purpose it that anyone who wants to clean his locality and need help in doing that, they can post a request with an image in this portal and anyone who is willing to help in cleaning his/her own city can then upload the clean place image as a fellow volunteer.

As soon as the person who had posted, verifies that the place is clean , the volunteer receives a certificate from the government in his/her email automatically. It works as a driving force and creates a sense of Responsibility. There will be a leaderboard which shows the number of locations one has cleaned as well which will motivate people to Clean more and more.

Dream of a clean city is still a dream of many.
Let's clean our nation!!!

Pristine- a city cleaning app

Idea 1: It's related to cleaning the cities which are highly polluted. 1st is using this website to create awareness which is basic.

Cleaning the city is a very important thing which everyone knows, still, some cities are so dirty. So we need something more to create motivation for ordinary people. Garbage management and all are not enough, people need to participate in it

So 2nd, which is the main objective is can create a platform that gives badges (like Google platforms) or points to those who:

Maps or locate the dirty areas. And updating about it

Who forms a small group, cleans the mapped location, and earns points and badges.

The 1st one can keep track of it and then map it out of the list.

People can upload pictures of before and after. Can share their initiative of cleaning the city (that will create a self-proud thing for people)

And with those points or badges, we can set some milestones, completing those people can get awarded by the government may be in a form of a certificate or medal

To make it more tech-advanced: => We can use blockchain for authentication and maybe DB. => instead of a certificate, we can give a unique NFT => ML for creating charts and prediction of a future trend like the rate of decrease in pollution and estimate dates...

It's a social cause project, good for hackathons and techy too
